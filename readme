This project creates an API for a cricket match platform with role-based access control, 
allowing guests to view match details and admins to manage match data
This API supports a platform similar to Cricbuzz, 
where guest users can browse matches and see their details, 
while admins can perform operations such as adding matches, players, updating stats, and scores.
